# UKRoadAccidentAnalysis #
Created a dashboard to analyze road accidents for the years 2021 and 2022  

The project involved gathering requirements from stakeholders, connecting to raw data, cleaning and processing data using Power Query, and creating custom columns and measures in the reports.   

Used DAX functions to calculate YTD (Year to Date) and YoY (Year To Year) growth, and generated insights through data visualization and chart design. The dashboard provided insight into key performance indicators such as total casualties, total accidents, casualties by accident severity, vehicle type, road type, area/location, and time of day based on different options of weather conditions and road surface.
